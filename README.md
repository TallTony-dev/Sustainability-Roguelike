# C# Roguelike Development
This is a game I am was developing in the Monogame framework which is based off of Microsoft XNA. I used this framework in order to learn more about how C# as a programming language works, and I also learned about game design in the process. I learned a lot from developing this game as my first real major programming project, especially due to using a framework instead of a full featured engine, which allowed me to learn ways to structure files using C# and in general. Despite not yet being a fully finished and polished game, largely due to having other projects and more valuable skills to develop, I learned a lot about programming as a general field and idea from working on this. Looking back a lot of this could have been done better, for one using a dictionary instead of arrays in order to make texture handling more easy to scale, and a good chunk is just pretty sloppy, but knowing that past you could do better just shows progress.
