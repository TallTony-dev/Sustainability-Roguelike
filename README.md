This is a game I am currently developing in the Monogame framework which is based off of Microsoft XNA. I am using this framework in order to learn more about how C# as a programming language works. I am also learning about game design in the process. This game is going to be sold on Steam and Itch.io with all proceeds going to the ecology action centre, a wildlife protection charity based in Nova Scotia.
