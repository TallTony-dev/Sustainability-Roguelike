This is a game I am currently developing in the Monogame framework which is based off of Microsoft XNA. I am using this framework in order to learn more about how C# as a programming language works. I am also learning about game design in the process. Once (if) this game is finished, it is going to be sold (choose your own price) with all proceeds going to the ecology action centre, a wildlife protection charity based in Nova Scotia.
